Mastermind

Sides:
This game has two sides: the codemaker and the codebreaker.  The codebreaker has to guess the code generated by the codemaker at the beginning of the game.  

The code:
A code consists of unique sequence of 6 pegs, each one of which is one of 8 colors.  Each color can be used more than once.  The codemaker generates the code at the beginning of the game and it remains that way until it is guessed.  The colors are (R)ed, (B)lue, (G)reen, (Y)ellow, (P)urple, (O)range, (W)hite, and (C)yan.

The guess:
The codebreaker is charged with guessing the code until he gets it right.  When the codebreaker announces a guess, the codemaker says how many colors are correct, and how many correct colors are also in the correct position.  E.g. if the code is RGB, and the guess is RBY, then the codemaker would respond "2 colors correct, 1 correct position".

Winning:
In this version of Mastermind, there is no limit to the number of guesses.  The codebreaker guesses until he gets it.  However, the goal is to write the codebreaker so that he has the lowest average number of guesses for the test set.
